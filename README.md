# AAU-Homework-Save-sensor-data-in-a-file
## Assignment:
Create an Unity project that has a single button as an input control - when the button is pressed, data from a sensor of your choice (accelerometer and/or Gyroscope) should be collected, and saved in a file for a certain period.

You should run your app 10 times, and save 10 .CSV files. The idea is to use the data you generate in the Sofia's course :-)

Try keeping your phone in a vertical position on a table, with some soft surface. Drop the phone, so it lands on the table. Collect sensor data for 10 repetitions of this experiment!

Upload the whole project on your GitHub repositoy, and upload a link to it here!
